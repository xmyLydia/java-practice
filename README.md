# java-practice
fundamental practice for building up strong base and preparation for advanced java.
1. constructor
2. inheritance
3. reference, object, instance, class
4. this, super, static
5. overriding and overloading, covariant return type
6. static vs instance method (which to use)
7. static vs instance variable (static: shared between instance)
8. extends Object class
9. composition vs inheritance
10. encapsulation: protect fields
11. polymorphism: unique functionality in inherited class
12. array, bubble sorting (while flag + for loop), common error (index out of bounds)„ÄÅ
13. reference type and value type
14. arrayList (advantage: automatic re-sizing)
15. arrayList (crud operations), scanner.nextLine() and scanner.nextInt()
16. arrayList, how to copy arraylist: 1) addAll 2) initialization with previous one (new arraylist<>(previousList)), 
    turn arraylist into the array: toArray(T a) method
17. factory method to create a new object
18. ClassA.method() call Class_a.method and enhance it according to scenario in ClassA. 
    class_ a is a variable of classA (contact and mobilePhone)
19. deal with duplicate in arrayList: indexOf() method's return value
20. arraylist store object (not primitive type data); primitive vs reference (stored in stack or heap); 
    autoboxing and unboxing
21. linkedList: save more work when add/delete one element from list, arrayList has to move many elements to the next position when saving,
    arrayList has to move many elements to the previous position when deleting.
22. iterator & listIterator, insert and remove of linkedList.
23. listIterator's infinite loop when using iterator.previous() and followed by iterator.next() because the implementation of its cursor.
